Interface to the image correlation spectroscopy library ICSx64.dll
==================================================================

ICSdll is a Python ctypes interface to the Image Correlation Spectroscopy
Dynamic Link Library (ICSx64.dll) developed at the Laboratory for Fluorescence
Dynamics (LFD) for the Globals for Images SimFCS software.

ICSx64.dll is implemented in C++ using the Intel(r) oneAPI Math Kernel Library
and OpenMP. It provides functions and classes for the analysis of fluorescence
time series data:

- 1D, 2D, and 3D auto- and cross-correlation
- Image pair correlation function (ipCF)
- Airy detector pair correlation function (apCF)
- Image mean square displacement (iMSD)
- Line spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy (lSTICS)
- Fit 1D pair correlation functions to the results of ipCF analysis
- Subtract immobile fractions
- Correct photo-bleaching
- 1D DFTs of image stack
